This is a simple implementation of the Fizz Buzz game in Python. The game prompts the user for two numbers and a maximum range, then prints numbers from 1 up to the maximum range with the following rules:
- Print "Fizz" for multiples of the first number.
- Print "Buzz" for multiples of the second number.
- Print "FizzBuzz" for multiples of both numbers.
